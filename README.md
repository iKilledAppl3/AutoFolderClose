# AutoFolderClose
"Is it drafty in here or is it just me?.... Close that folder already!"
Ever get tired of having to close your folder after you exit an application that was launched from said folder?
No problem! With AutoFolderClose you can now have your folder automatically close when you launch an application! 
This works with iOS 13.0 - 13.4!
